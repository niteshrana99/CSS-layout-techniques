CSS box model is imp to set sixe of element. Acc to this model every element is a box. The total width or height is-- content+2*padding+2*border+2*padding

WIDTH AND HEIGHT:::
The height and width on span elements won't work. 

BORDER: Border lies between margin and padding:

total width: 200+5+5
border: 5px solid black is eqivalent to
border-width:5px
border-style=solid
border-color=black

We cab also set border-top-style etc for all differnt border

Similarly border-top-color Also if we want to set different width then border-top-width etc;

MARGIN AND PADDINg: MArgin is outside border PAdding is between content and border.
Different values can be set as padding-top, left , right, bottom
Padding can also be added to inline elements.
For inline elements margin can only be left and right not top and bottom

Using box-sizing property.
With the help of box sizing property we can change the way size is calculated.
Default value:: box-sizing:content-box== when we want to know the total width we have to add content +2* padding + 2*border +2*margin which are by default.
2. box-sizing: padding-box: In this case the padding values will be included within the specified width. So content will shrunk to accomodate the content. So we need only to add margin and border
3. box-sizing:border-box:We need to add only margin.
